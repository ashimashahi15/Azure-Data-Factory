To get the list of the files or folders from a specific location in Azure blob storage, use the following steps:
Go to the data factory and create one pipeline.
Create a linked service which will point to the Azure blob storage location.
Create a dataset for Azure blob storage using the linked service created in above steps.
Go to the activity search box and type getmetadata. In the results section you will see getmetadata activity. Drag and drop this activity into the pipeline designer tab.
Select getmetadata activity and go to the dataset tab. Under the dataset tab you will see  the field dataset there.
Select the dataset which we have created in above step to connect to the Azure blob storage.
Scroll down and there you will see the attribute field list. In front of it you will see a plus sign click on it. 
Drop down box will appear, in this drop down box you will see multiple properties.
Here for now just select the child items as we wanted to select all the list of file names and folder names available inside the folder location.
This will return the list of all the folders and files available inside our pointed location along with their type.
